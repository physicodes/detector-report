\chapter*{Abstract}

A proportional counter was built from commonly found items, and tested using common laboratory equipment to characterise the detector. Its performance was characterised by its proportionality and energy resolution, by measuring the spectra of \textsuperscript{55}Fe and \textsuperscript{241}Am over a range of operational voltages. The detector was calibrated using spectral features of \textsuperscript{55}Fe and \textsuperscript{241}Am, and applied to measure the energies of unknown peaks in the spectrum of a \textsuperscript{241}Am sample. To further explore the limits of this low cost apparatus, a kit built preamplifier from Texas Instruments was used. The results obtained are limited by the detector's energy resolution, but are surprisingly sensitive nonetheless, showing clear peaks where expected.
